# Micromouse
Designed and built a robot capable of navigating through a maze in the shortest time. 

Key contributions include:

Robot Manufacture and Assembly: Developed the robot's physical structure using 3D printing and laser cutting. Assembled the components with mechanical bolts and screws.

Maze Path Planning: 
1. 'path_planning.ipynb': Implemented path planning in Python with OpenCV.
2. 'micro-mouse-path.py': Created an occupancy grid from a maze image, detected walls, and generated an optimal path using the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
